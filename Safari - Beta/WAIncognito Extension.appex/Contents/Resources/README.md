# Invisible mode for WhatsApp Web
This is the source code of a chrome extension that disables read receipts and presence updates on WhatsApp Web.
You can find the original extension in [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/waincognito/alhmbbnlcggfcjjfihglopfopcbigmil).

## Installing from GitHub directly
To install the extension off-store, download the latest release as a zip file from the [Releases](https://github.com/tomer8007/whats-incognito/releases) page, 
**extract its content to a directory** and add it to Chrome using the 'Load unpacked extension' option when developer mode is turned on.

## How it works
This extension works by intercepting the WebSocket frames between chrome and WhatsApp's servers using a modified `WebSocket` constructor (see [wsHook](https://github.com/skepticfx/wshook)).

Those frames are then decrypted if needed using the local encryption keys (stored in `localStorage`), and decoded from a binary form using a javascript code from WhatsApp's original implementation.

The resulting "nodes" are then simply checked to see if WhatsApp tries to send out a `read` or `presence` action, and if so, the extension blocks it and fakes a failure response from the server.
## Organization & Internals
The main code of the extension is located in `core/interception.js` and in `core/ui.js`. 

Other files inside the `core` folder deal with the infrastructure that makes the interception and the decoding works. There is also an additional `parsing/` code for parsing messages (such as `message_types.js`) that is rarely used in the extension.
`background.js` mainly keeps track of the saved preferences using `localStorage`.

If you want to see what kind of messages WhatsApp is sending and receiving over WebSocket in real-time, you can type `WAdebugMode = true` in the javascript console. Incoming and outgoing payloads (after decryption) will be printed out.
